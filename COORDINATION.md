## Scope Lock Rules
- This session owns all files (solo session, no conflicts detected)
- This session's branch is arena/5d32bca3-maltaproj8 — all work on this branch, push only here, PR from here
- Files owned exclusively by this session — no overlapping parallel sessions observed
- Small frequent commits; git pull --rebase before every push
- Never mark verified without official source link — enforced on every table row

## Flagged Irregularities — Published on Site
See flag.html on GH Pages site. 10 flagged items: F-01 Kalshi NO IRS guidance, F-02 §1256 aggressive, F-03 gambling sports contract risk, F-04 all coverage-loss estimates are projections, F-05 high-unemployment threshold TBD, F-06 ACWDL 25-30 preliminary post-dated by IFC, F-07 enrollment point-in-time variance, F-08 Kalshi 1099 gap, F-09 H.R. 10357 pending legislation, F-10 full-price premium averages.

## Parallel-session addendum — arena-b4c93f27
- Concurrent main change discovered after PR #1 opened: PR #2, commit f6eb054, from arena/5d32bca3. Both sessions started from the empty initial commit and independently claimed all files before either claim was visible on main.
- Stopped overlapping root-page edits. Preserved ALL other-session root pages, data, docs, README, workflow and styling without overwriting them. This session's dashboard is isolated to `research/`; verification-only CI is `.github/workflows/research.yml`. Only COORDINATION.md required textual conflict resolution; both logs are retained below. README delete/modify conflict resolved by retaining other session's root README and this session's research/README.md.
- Integration request to root-site owner: optionally link `/research/` from root navigation. No claimed root navigation file edited by this session.
- PR #1: https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/MaltaProj8/pull/1 . It now adds a supplemental research dashboard, not a replacement for PR #2. Its own source register has 52 findings; other-session findings are retained as independently authored material, not newly certified by this session.

## Log
- 2026-10-18: Empty repository inspected (README only); no existing claims. Sole session claims research and integration. No other session work found. Will verify official sources, publish unresolved issues on Flagged for Review, validate and deploy.
- 2026-10-18: Initial pull of session branch failed because remote branch did not yet exist. Pulled/rebased main before first session-branch push; no conflicts or other session changes.
- Research: 52 row register, 16 official references. CMS July 2026 slide 12 confirms MAGI-based monthly household income; DHCS MEDIL I26-25 enclosure confirms income from any source. Sources: https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/downloads/ce-requirement-ifc-deck.pdf ; https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/09/MEDIL-I26-25.pdf . Remaining official URLs and review locators are in data/findings.json and sources.html.
- Verification: each substantive row checked against its cited official guidance or flagged with blank unconfirmed value. Recommendations labeled. General IRS trader rules are not treated as Kalshi-specific guidance. Large statute/rule checked for relevant provisions, not certified in full. Flagged page includes start-date and income-wording conflicts, unknown personal eligibility, Kalshi tax/activity classification, property-management hours and seasonal-worker scope.
- Build: nine static pages, source library, CSV/JSON, responsive CSS and progressive-enhancement table search. Python build/validation pass: all rows have sources, local links/fragments resolve, unresolved values blank, unique IDs. External source retrieval succeeded for substantive references; GovInfo legal-edition link is a reference supplied by Federal Register, not a full PDF audit.
- Publication configuration: existing Pages uses main/root legacy publishing. Attempt to switch to Actions received HTTP 403 (resource not accessible by integration); preserved existing mode, added .nojekyll and committed prebuilt static HTML. CI validates and stages an artifact; legacy Pages publishes on main merge. No authentication secrets requested or stored.
## Final Deployment Record
- **PR:** https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/MaltaProj8/pull/2 — **MERGED** at 2026-10-18T19:14:52Z
- **Merge type:** merge commit (f6eb054)
- **Branches:** `arena/5d32bca3-maltaproj8` → `main` (fast-forward via merge)
- **GitHub Pages:** https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/MaltaProj8/
  - Status: **built** (confirmed via GitHub Pages API `status: built` at 2026-10-18 19:16 UTC)
  - Workflow `pages build and deployment`: **success** (completed) at https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/MaltaProj8/actions/runs/39157883702
  - Workflow `Deploy GitHub Pages` (.github/workflows/pages.yml): in_progress / pending → completed successfully
  - Source: branch `main` path `/` (legacy build type, html_url https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/MaltaProj8/)
- **Verification:** All internal links checked locally (no broken); all 5 JSON files valid; site responsive; every table row has source link; flagged items on /flagged.html
- **Deliverables:** Executive summary + 6 subpages + data JSONs + verification log + flagged page — all live on Pages
- Follow-up integration: concurrent deployment-record commit f1f87ae caused a second coordination-only conflict; retained both deployment record and supplemental log. A normal rebase attempted to flatten the integration merge and reproduced conflicts; aborted without losing changes and used `git pull --rebase=merges` to preserve both histories. No source/page work discarded.
- Supplemental dashboard tests: 52 source-linked rows, nine static pages, no broken local links/fragments, all root relative file links resolve, local HTTP smoke passes. PR CI run 39157963633 passed.

## Parallel-session addendum — 05508cd2
- Session `05508cd2` began from the initial empty commit and claimed research/integration on fixed branch `arena/05508cd2-maltaproj8` before concurrent claims were visible on main.
- PR #3 encountered concurrent main publication (PR #1 / #2). Stopped overlapping root work, read the complete main coordination board, and preserved the primary root site plus the other supplemental `research/` dashboard. This session's 65-row dashboard is now isolated in `coverage-guide/`; validation-only workflow is `.github/workflows/coverage-guide.yml`. No other session's research, root navigation, pages or data is edited or certified by this session.
- Claimed revised scope: `coverage-guide/**`, `.github/workflows/coverage-guide.yml`, `.gitignore`, coordination append-only log. Integration request to primary owner: optionally add a link to `/coverage-guide/` in the primary navigation. No primary navigation edit performed.
- Research done: 65 findings / 18 official sources, with exact URLs, locators, excerpts/retrieval scope and conditional analysis in `coverage-guide/research/findings.json`, rendered at `coverage-guide/pages/sources.html`.
- Review items (published with blank unresolved values): Jan/March date discrepancy, Kalshi classification/hours, own-property management hours, missing personal eligibility facts, three $1 FPL differences, earnings wording, seasonal-worker averaging, 2027 figures/quotes, external-link/full-document verification limits. No missing values inferred.
- Verification before relocation: 7 pages / 84 local references, source allowlist, row evidence, unique IDs, deterministic build passed. Chromium tests passed all 7 routes, active navigation, filters/empty state, 390px overflow, no-JS content and runtime errors. Desktop appearance inspected. Initial browser launch missing system libraries was resolved using packaged test-only libraries outside Git.
- Original branch creation: remote session branch did not exist; pulled main before first push. Later pull failed on uncommitted integration files; committed all work before retrying successfully. No other-session changes discarded.
- Initial PR #3 validation passed (run 39158557775). PR: https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/MaltaProj8/pull/3 . Final combined-tree validation and deployment pending below.
- Combined-tree integration produced an add/add conflict only in COORDINATION.md. Resolved by retaining the precombined board copied from current main plus this session’s addendum; both other-session logs remain intact. All other files integrated automatically without discarding work.
- Post-integration recheck: all 24 HTML pages / 366 local links, assets and fragments resolved across the preserved root, research and coverage-guide sites. This session’s 65-row/18-source/7-page validator and relocated-path Chromium tests passed. Other session’s 52-row/9-page validator passed when run from its documented research/ working directory (initial invocation from root failed only because its script uses cwd-relative paths). Other sessions’ medical findings are preserved, not independently recertified by this session.
